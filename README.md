# Youtube Comments Sidebar

This userscript swaps the suggested videos sidebar with the comments section on Youtube videos. This is a personal preference, but I find it more convenient to have the comments section on the right side of the video player.

## Install

## Instructions

To use this script, you will need a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey. Follow these steps to install the script:

1. Install a userscript manager extension in your browser:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
2. Click on the install badge above.
3. The userscript manager should prompt you to install the script. Confirm the installation.

## Usage

Once installed, the script runs automatically on Youtube video pages. There's no need for manual activation.

## Known Issues

- There is this scrollbar that appears on the page which doesn't belong to the primary and secondary columns. I am too lazy to find which element is causing this issue. If you find it, please create a pull request.
